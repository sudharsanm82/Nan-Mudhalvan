# üéôÔ∏è Accent Aware ASR - Colab Notebook

> An interactive notebook to build an Accent-Aware Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using Python and deep learning.

---

## üìù Project Description

This project explores how accent variations affect ASR performance and aims to develop a model that adapts to diverse speech accents. It uses a Colab-based notebook to make it accessible for research and experimentation.

### üì¶ Step 2: Upload Your Dataset
- Prepare your dataset with:
  - `.flac` audio files
  - `transcript.txt` formatted as:
    ```
    file_001 SOME TRANSCRIPTED TEXT
    file_002 ANOTHER LINE
    ```

- Upload files using Colab's file upload widget or mount Google Drive.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Install Dependencies (Handled in Notebook)
The notebook auto-installs the following packages:
```bash
torchaudio
transformers
librosa
scikit-learn
pydub

Follow the cells for:

Feature extraction (MFCCs, spectrograms)

Data preparation

Accent classification or adaptation (if included)

ASR model training

üé§ Step 4: Inference & Transcription
Record audio via microphone (if supported).

Run inference to generate a transcript.

Output includes timestamps and recognized text.
